        <p>Website - Information Design (Summer 2020)</p>
        <h4>Softwares/Skills used:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 + CSS3 + Adobe Photoshop + Figma</p>
        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
        <p>
          This is a project required to design an information website for a
          fictional mountain safety and rescue team. As a non-profit
          association, this website mainly accounts for popularizing the safety
          guidelines and rescue knowledge about two topics: Avalanche and
          Hypothermia, as well as introducing the team itself. For this type of
          web design, the focus will be on getting the right key guidance
          information to the user accurately and clearly, while maintaining the
          aesthetics is second to none. We (the team project) created the mockup
          in Figma for layout testing and then gradually created the framework.
          Since it was a multi-person task, we paid a lot of attention to
          consistency such as the layout, the color selected, and the image
          style. Then, key information was populated. Finally, by adding
          interaction patterns such as mouse clicks and dragging, a prototype of
          a website that can be used for advertising purposes takes shape.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          From my point of view, we were happy with what we had created, even
          though we didn't have very good coding skills at the time, so we had
          to use Figma. This website is the first website design I have ever
          been involved in, and the early stages of my involvement in a teamwork
          project. I hope to bring an effective, high-level contribution to the
          team. Our team is also committed to making a professional and useful
          website. The layout of each page has the same design language and
          color scheme, all for the same purpose which is our theme. We
          conducted formative usability testing at various stages of the design
          process and received good results and feedback. Our information
          section uses text and visual elements to collaborate with each other,
          making it easier for users to read and thus providing a better reading
          experience. Overall, our website design successfully communicates to
          users what they want. In the process, I gained a lot of knowledge
          about information design and the basic rules of web development.

        <h3>Soccer Customization for You</h3>
        <img src="img/S1.jpg" class="sg_mw_img" alt="Project 2." />
        <h4>Project Info:</h4>
        <p>Website - Brand/Company Design (Fall 2022)</p>
        <h4>Softwares/Skills used:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript + Adobe Photoshop</p>
        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
        <p>
          This is a project required to design a website for a fictional company
          we established, “Soccer Customization for You”. This company provides
          services such as selling the latest soccer cleats and unique cleats
          customization. As a soccer shoe company that wants to compete among
          other sports brand majors and resellers, the company not only needs to
          offer a unique service, the company website design needs to balance
          the aesthetics of the layout and complete functionality so as to give
          the user the best experience. According to the feedback, the website
          refers to the design of big sports brands, which is a simple
          black-and-white color design style. And the homepage was chosen to
          include images of custom soccer shoes, which were presented to users
          using a scrolling format. In order to ensure convenience, the site was
          kept to a minimum, from the homepage, getting to know us, browsing the
          products and learning more about them, to the final step of creating
          an order. Starting with the framework, I have addressed the necessary
          elements of the page layout. Then advanced features are added, such as
          images that can be scrolled and product detail images that can be
          enlarged when clicked. And the site is filled with real content,
          enough for business use.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          From my point of view, I am satisfied with my design. The testing of
          usability was passable because all the features needed for a soccer
          shoe company's website were implemented, such as a complete product
          list, an informative product detail page, a minimalistic shopping cart
          and a payment interface. In terms of design aesthetics, consistency
          was well implemented, with a minimalist black-and-white style,
          interspersed with appropriate and distinctive images, and a logical
          reading layout that worked well with each other to compose the site.
          The area that deserves improvement would be the mobile version, the
          part that is the responsibility of the partner to whom I did not
          contribute much to this project. The site does not adapt well to other
          devices of different sizes. Overall, I think this project has been a
          good exercise in user-centered design.
