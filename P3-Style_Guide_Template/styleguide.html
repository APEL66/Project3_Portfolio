        <h4>Project Info:</h4>
        <p>Website - Information Design (Summer 2020)</p>
        <h4>Softwares/Skills used:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 + CSS3 + Adobe Photoshop + Figma</p>
        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
        <p>
          This was a project that required the design of an informative website
          for a fictional mountain safety rescue team. As a non-profit
          association, this website is responsible for popularizing safety
          guidelines and knowledge about rescue on two topics. Avalanches and
          Hypothermia, as well as introducing the team itself. For this type of
          web design, the focus was on getting the right key instructional
          information to the user accurately and clearly, while maintaining
          aesthetics as a secondary concern. First, we (the team project)
          started by determining the general content and web style such as
          colors, images, fonts, etc. that the web page would display. Since
          this was a multi-person task, we paid close attention to consistency.
          Next, a roughly content-free framework was created in Figma for layout
          testing. Then, a preliminary layout was formed after continuous
          testing. Then the key information was populated. Finally, by adding
          interaction patterns, such as mouse clicks and dragging, a prototype
          of a website that could be used for advertising was formed.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          From my point of view, we were happy with what we had created, even
          though we didn't have very good coding skills at the time, so we had
          to use Figma. This website is the first website design I have ever
          been involved in, and the early stages of my involvement in a teamwork
          project. I hope to bring an effective, high-level contribution to the
          team. Our team is also committed to making a professional and useful
          website. The layout of each page has the same design language and
          color scheme, all for the same purpose which is our theme. We
          conducted formative usability testing at various stages of the design
          process and received good results and feedback. Our information
          section uses text and visual elements to collaborate with each other,
          making it easier for users to read and thus providing a better reading
          experience. Overall, our website design successfully communicates to
          users what they want. In the process, I gained a lot of knowledge
          about information design and the basic rules of web development.

        <img src="img/S1.jpg" class="sg_mw_img" alt="Project 2." />
        <h4>Project Info:</h4>
        <p>Website - Brand/Company Design (Fall 2022)</p>
        <h4>Softwares/Skills used:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript + Adobe Photoshop</p>
        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
        <p>
          This was a project that required the design of a website for a
          fictional company we built called Soccer Customization for You. This
          company offers services that include selling the latest soccer shoes
          and unique soccer shoe customization. As a soccer shoe company that
          wanted to compete among other big sports brand names and distributors,
          the company not only needed to offer unique services, the company
          website design needed to balance the aesthetics of the layout with
          complete functionality in order to give the user the best experience
          possible. First, I created a style guide that identified the site's
          color and font choices, button styles, hover for text and image links,
          module components, and more. Then created a draft site homepage and
          product listing page from this. Based on the feedback, the site would
          reference the design of big sports brands in a simple black and white
          color design style. Then, after adjusting the style, I created the
          product detail page, shopping cart and checkout interface. Changes
          were then made based on the feedback to create a complete shopping
          process from scratch. Next, key information was filled in and advanced
          features were added, such as scrollable images and product detail
          images that could be enlarged when clicked. Finally, after validator
          checking and testing, a website full of real content that is good
          enough for commercial use was created.

        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          From my point of view, I am satisfied with my design. The testing of
          usability was passable because all the features needed for a soccer
          shoe company's website were implemented, such as a complete product
          list, an informative product detail page, a minimalistic shopping cart
          and a payment interface. In terms of design aesthetics, consistency
          was well implemented, with a minimalist black-and-white style,
          interspersed with appropriate and distinctive images, and a logical
          reading layout that worked well with each other to compose the site.
          The area that deserves improvement would be the mobile version, the
          part that is the responsibility of the partner to whom I did not
          contribute much to this project. The site does not adapt well to other
          devices of different sizes. Overall, I think this project has been a
          good exercise in user-centered design.
